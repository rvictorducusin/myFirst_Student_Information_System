# myFirst_Student_Information_System
This was my first Java Program

This Program is used to manage student's data like grades, subjects, etc..  
This program was created using Java language in Netbeans.  
If you want to develop this System just keep it to yourself I am not interested on developing this Program further.  
I will remain this as it is as this will be a remembrance of how I started learning programming and created my very own SIS version.

Enjoy and keep writing codes
